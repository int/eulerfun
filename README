This is the code for running http://eulerfun.appspot.com/ ,
which show my solutions to http://projecteuler.net/ .

Following the Project Euler no-spoiler tradition,

1) you can only see the solutions if you submit the correct answer.
2) there are no answer or solution code explicitly present in this project.
